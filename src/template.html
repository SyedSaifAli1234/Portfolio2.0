                    Product support team can now create custom IVR flows by just dragging and dropping steps like flow chart and can manage different versions easily.
                  </p>
                  <ul style="font-size: 10px">
                    <li>
                      Developed an Interactive Voice Response (IVR) application using React, Nextjs, Java, Spring Boot, Istio, Redis, MySQL, Docker, and Kubernetes to manage IVRs, versions, users, and roles.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Created reusable React components and wrote Jest test cases for each component to ensure functionality and quality.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Optimized front-end modules using useCallback, useMemo, and useSwr to improve performance and integrated the front-end with Istio service mesh, Oauth2-proxy, and Keycloak OIDC for secure access.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Implemented server-side rendering of Next.js for modules that need client-specific configurations to prevent the flicker effect on browsers.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Secured the application using JWT and HTTP-only cookies and developed a validations utility in Spring Boot to ensure data accuracy.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Integrated observability tools like Kiali, Jaeger, and Prometheus for traceability and developed modules for IVR Management, Version Management, User Management, and Roles Management.
                    </li>
